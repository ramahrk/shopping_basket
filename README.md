  - 10% discount on Apples
  - Buy 2 tins of soup, get bread for half price
- Command-line interface

  export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

### Step 2: Install SBT

**Windows**:
1. Download from https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html
2. Download the Windows MSI installer and complete the installation.
3. Locate the SBT Installation Directory
4. Edit the system environment variables and add SBT to your system PATH

**Ubuntu/Debian**:
```bash
echo "deb https://repo.scala-sbt.org/scalasbt/debian all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
curl -sL "https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x99E82A75642AC823" | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sbt -y
```

### Step 3: Clone and Setup Project

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd shopping-basket-new
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
java --version
sbt version
sbt compile
```

```

#### Example 2: Soup and bread offer
```bash
sbt "run Soup Soup Bread"
```
```
Subtotal: GBP 2.10
Buy 2 Soup get Bread half price: 40p

sbt "run Milk"
```
```
Subtotal: GBP 1.30
(No offers available)
Total price: GBP 1.30
```

#### Example 4: Multiple offers
```bash
sbt "run Soup Soup Bread Apples"
```
```
Subtotal: GBP 3.10
Apples 10% off: 10p

Subtotal: GBP 2.30
Apples 10% off: 10p
Total price: GBP 2.20
```

```

## Special Offers

- Apples 10% off (`ApplesDiscount.scala`)
- Buy 2 Soups get Bread half price (`SoupBreadOffer.scala`)

Offers apply only when conditions are met, and multiple offers can apply together.

## Development Tips

### Add a New Item

Update `availableItems` map in `Main.scala`.

### Add a New Offer

Create a new `Offer` object extending the `Offer` trait and add it to `OfferEngine.scala`.

### Continuous Dev Mode

```bash
sbt ~compile
sbt ~test
```

## Encoding Note (Windows Terminal)

On **Windows terminals** (e.g., PowerShell, Git Bash), the pound symbol `Â£` may render incorrectly as garbled characters (like `â”¬Ãº`) due to code page or font limitations.

### Resolution / Fix

This issue has been fixed by updating the currency output:

- `CurrencyFormatter.scala` now uses `"GBP"` instead of `Â£`  
  Example: `Subtotal: GBP 3.10` instead of `Subtotal: Â£3.10`

### Supported Environments

You can safely run the application from:

- **Linux/macOS terminals**
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**
- **Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe)**
- **PowerShell and Git Bash** â€” now also display correct output

> If reverting to the `Â£` symbol, use WSL or change Windows code page with `chcp 65001`.

## Code Quality & Error Handling

This project includes robust error handling and well-documented source code:

- **Input Validation**: Warnings for unknown items, ignored in calculations
- **Safe Runtime**: Uses `Option`, pattern matching, and guards against invalid operations
- **Clear Exceptions**: Graceful error messages for invalid inputs and states
- **Encapsulation**: Separated concerns across services, models, and utilities
- **Scaladoc Comments**: Documented every core class and function
- **Formatted Output**: Output formatting via centralized `CurrencyFormatter`

---

## Quick Start

```bash
java -version
sbt version
git clone <repo>
cd shopping-basket-new
sbt compile
sbt "run Apples Milk Bread"
sbt test
```

## Conclusion

This application fulfills all assignment requirements for:

- Functional discount logic
- Clean modular architecture
- Command-line interface
- Unit tests for correctness
- Easily extensible offer system â€“ New offers can be implemented by:
  - Creating a new object extending the `Offer` trait
  - Implementing custom discount logic in the `apply` method
  - Registering the new offer in `OfferEngine.scala`
